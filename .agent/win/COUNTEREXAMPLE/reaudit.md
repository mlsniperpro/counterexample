# Re-audit log (Counterexample)

Each audit is a full pass over the whole entry, as a strict judge and a hostile senior reviewer: correctness, security, robustness, performance, UX, docs-vs-code truth, and brief compliance. Tools: a manual read plus the `code-review` skill at high effort.

## Round 6 (2026-10-25, `04f1f92`, four parallel full audits: agent core, security, judge view and docs truth, UI/tests/scalability)

Found 37 (5 high, 18 medium, 14 low; no critical), plus a false alarm seen in a benchmark run against the sandbox container. All are fixed with regression tests in `3b0bf80`, `5d4f6c6` and `99ed3a2`, so the clean-audit count stays at 0. The full list is under "Round 6" in WIN-CHECKLIST.md. The highs:
1. An unconfirmed (spurious) mismatch was claimed as a bug. Under load, a correct binary search was reported broken against the Judge0-compatible sandbox.
2. Correct code returning an object with its keys in a different order was flagged.
3. A solution's output was never size-limited: 4 MB reached the stream, the DOM and the explain prompt.
4. Submitted code had outbound network access from the sandbox.
5. The checklist cited break-it.md before it existed.

## Round 4b (2026-10-24, working tree before the gate kit commit)

Found 10, all fixed before this commit, so the clean-audit count stays at 0:

1. A bitwise-risk regex matched `|| 0`.
2. Edited demo code in another language replayed a wrong-language fix.
3. Small-scope graph enumeration was unbounded for large `n`.
4. One failed research question aborted the others.
5. The stage reasons listed APIs dropped by the cap.
6. Auto mode researched code patterns, against the brief.
7. Small-scope ignored the per-family budget; the mutation family did too, which the new test caught.
8. The README soak numbers predated the code, and `--readme` wrote even on a failing run.
9. The diff was not memoised.
10. A CRLF diff showed every line as changed.

Next: two consecutive full audits that find nothing, each recorded here with its commit.
