# Re-audit log (Counterexample)

Each audit is a full pass over the whole entry, as a strict judge and a hostile senior reviewer: correctness, security, robustness, performance, UX, docs-vs-code truth, and brief compliance. Tools: a manual read plus the `code-review` skill at high effort.

## Round 4b (2026-10-24, working tree before the gate kit commit)

Found 10, all fixed before this commit, so the clean-audit count stays at 0:

1. A bitwise-risk regex matched `|| 0`.
2. Edited demo code in another language replayed a wrong-language fix.
3. Small-scope graph enumeration was unbounded for large `n`.
4. One failed research question aborted the others.
5. The stage reasons listed APIs dropped by the cap.
6. Auto mode researched code patterns, against the brief.
7. Small-scope ignored the per-family budget; the mutation family did too, which the new test caught.
8. The README soak numbers predated the code, and `--readme` wrote even on a failing run.
9. The diff was not memoised.
10. A CRLF diff showed every line as changed.

Next: two consecutive full audits that find nothing, each recorded here with its commit.
